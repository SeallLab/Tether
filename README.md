# Tether

A productivity dock designed specifically for software engineers with ADHD. Tether provides ambient activity monitoring, AI-powered assistance, and gamified focus rewards to help you stay on track.

## First Time Setup

**Important:** When you first open Tether, it may take 30-60 seconds to fully initialize. The app is setting up its Python backend and indexing research documents in the background. Be patient during this initial startup!

### Getting Started

1. **Launch Tether** - The dock will appear as a small floating panel
2. **First Run**: Wait for initial setup (30-60 seconds)
3. **Set Up Permissions** - Go to System Settings and grant the required permissions (see below)
4. **Restart Tether** - After setting up permissions, quit and relaunch the app
5. **Position the Dock** - Drag it to your preferred screen location

## Platform-Specific Setup

### 🪟 Windows Permissions Setup

Tether works well on Windows with minimal setup required:

#### Permissions

1. **Notifications**

   - Windows will automatically prompt you to allow notifications when Tether first runs
   - If you missed the prompt: Go to **Settings** > **System** > **Notifications**
   - Find **Tether** and ensure notifications are enabled

2. **Windows Defender/Antivirus** (if blocked)

   - If Windows Defender blocks Tether (unsigned app warning):
     - Go to **Windows Security** > **Virus & threat protection**
     - Click **Manage settings** under "Virus & threat protection settings"
     - Click **Add or remove exclusions**
     - Add the Tether installation folder as an exclusion

3. **Run at Startup** (recommended)

   - Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Startup**
   - Find **Tether** and toggle it **On**
   - This allows Tether to start automatically when you log in

#### Windows Installation Notes

- **Security Warnings**: Windows may show "Windows protected your PC" warnings
  - Click **More info** → **Run anyway** to proceed

### 🍎 macOS Permissions Setup

Tether needs several permissions to work properly. While macOS may prompt you automatically, it's recommended to set these up manually in System Settings:

#### Required Permissions

1. **Notifications**

   - Go to **System Settings** > **Notifications**
   - Find **Tether** in the list and click it
   - Enable **Allow notifications**
   - Recommended: Enable **Badges**, **Sounds**, and **Banners**

2. **Accessibility** (for advanced window tracking)
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility**
   - Click the **+** button and add **Tether**
   - Or check the box next to **Tether** if it's already listed

#### After Granting Permissions

- **Always restart Tether** after changing permissions in System Settings
- Quit the app completely and relaunch it for permissions to take effect

#### Troubleshooting Permissions

If activity monitoring or notifications aren't working:

1. Check that **Accessibility** permission is enabled
2. Check that **Notifications** permission is enabled
3. Restart Tether completely (quit and relaunch)
4. If issues persist, try removing and re-adding the permissions in System Settings
